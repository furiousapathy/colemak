# Switch to Colemak



https://first20hours.com/typing/

* I learned how to change my keyboard layout to Colemak.
* I created a fast feedback loop by rearranging the physical keys on the keyboard, so if I forgot where a character was located, I could find it easily.
* I used the Keyzen typing tutor to learn the placement of characters by touch, learning the most-used characters first. Keyzen re-introduced characters to the training set as I made mistakes, so I spent most of my time practicing difficult characters until my accuracy improved.
* I practiced for 45 minutes every night, just before going to bed, so my brain could consolidate the motor skills into long-term memory most effectively.
* Once I got to functional speed (20 WPM), I switched to Type-Fu, focusing on typing sentences as fast as possible with over 99% accuracy.
* When I reached 40 WPM, I used Amphetype to train the most common English bigrams and trigrams, further increasing my speed and accuracy.
* Once I mastered the n-gram set, I switched to training the most common English words in Amphetype until I reached 60 WPM sustained with 99% accuracy, which happened at the 21 hour mark.

Here’s a list of the 10,000 most common English words in order of frequency, as determined by n-gram frequency analysis of the Google Trillion Word Corpus.

This list is derived from Peter Novig’s compilation of the 1/3 million most frequent English words.

I imported this list into Amphetype to create training sets of common words.
